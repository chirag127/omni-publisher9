      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;best-apps-for-credit-card-bill-payment-cashback-in-india-2025&#34;&gt;Best Apps for Credit Card Bill Payment Cashback in India 2025&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Chirag Singhal | Updated November 21, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Paying credit card bills doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a chore—it&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to earn rewards! In 2025, India&amp;rsquo;s fintech landscape has evolved with UPI integrations, AI-driven reminders, and competitive cashback offers. This updated guide verifies over 20 platforms based on real-time data from official sites, user reviews, and recent promotions (sourced from Google searches and YouTube analyses as of November 2025). We&amp;rsquo;ve corrected inaccuracies from earlier lists—many &amp;ldquo;apps&amp;rdquo; like Instamojo, LazyPay, and Setu platforms focus on gateways or debit optimizations rather than direct cashback on credit card bills. Only verified cashback providers are included here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
