**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025
**Verified Status:** ✅ All tools checked for active free tiers.

Let's be real: paying $20/month for _every_ AI tool is unsustainable. You need a coding assistant, a debugger, a web builder, and a data agent. That adds up to $100/month fast.

But here's the secret the SaaS companies don't want you to know: **You can get a production-grade AI coding stack for $0.**

I have spent the last week testing, verifying, and ranking over 50 AI coding agents and platforms. These aren't just "free trials" that ask for a credit card and charge you after 7 days. These are tools with **generous, perpetual free tiers**, **open-source models**, or **cloud-based credits** that you can rotate for practically unlimited usage.

Whether you're a student, an indie hacker, or just frugal, this is your new bible for free AI coding.

## 🏆 The Top 5 "Must-Have" Free Agents

If you only use five tools from this list, make it these. They offer the highest value, the best models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude 3.5, GPT-4o), and the most generous limits.

### 1. Google Antigravity (Preview)

**The New King of Free.**
Google's latest agentic IDE is currently in a massive public preview. It gives you access to **Gemini 3 Pro**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, and **GPT-OSS** models completely for free.

-   **Free Tier:** Unlimited usage during preview, with rate limits that refresh every ~5 hours.
-   **Why it wins:** It's a full cloud IDE that runs on Google's infrastructure. No local GPU needed.
-   **Best For:** Full-stack development, complex refactoring.

### 2. Amazon Kiro

**The "Hidden Gem" Cloud IDE.**
Amazon's answer to Cursor, but fully cloud-native. Kiro offers a surprisingly generous free tier that renews monthly.

-   **Free Tier:** 50 credits/month (enough for ~2 weeks of heavy use).
-   **Bonus:** New accounts often get a 30-day trial with 500 bonus credits.
-   **Best For:** AWS integrations, Python/Node.js projects.

### 3. Bolt.new

**The Best Web Builder.**
Bolt allows you to prompt an entire full-stack app into existence in the browser.

-   **Free Tier:** Daily token limits (reset daily/monthly).
-   **Strategy:** Great for scaffolding. Once you hit the limit, export the code to a free IDE like Project IDX.
-   **Best For:** React/Next.js prototypes, landing pages.

### 4. Google Project IDX

**The "VS Code in the Cloud" Workhorse.**
A fully functional, cloud-based VS Code environment integrated with Gemini.

-   **Free Tier:** Free core usage. Up to 5 workspaces.
-   **Why it wins:** It's basically a high-power Linux machine in your browser with AI baked in.
-   **Best For:** Flutter, Angular, and Next.js development.

### 5. Codeium

**The Best Copilot Alternative.**
While GitHub Copilot is paid (unless you're a student), Codeium is free for individuals forever.

-   **Free Tier:** Unlimited autocomplete and free chat (Llama 3.1 70B).
-   **Why it wins:** It's fast, accurate, and doesn't artificially limit you to push you to a paid plan.
-   **Best For:** VS Code extension, local development.

## ⚠️ The Graveyard (Tools to Avoid)

These tools used to be free or generous but have recently changed their policies. **Don't get caught out.**

-   ❌ **Sourcegraph Cody:** The free tier for individuals has been discontinued.
-   ❌ **Fig:** Sunsetted and absorbed into Amazon Q.
-   ⚠️ **Replit:** The free tier is now very restrictive (limited compute, public only).

## 🔄 The "Infinite Free" Rotation Strategy

How do you code for free forever without hitting limits? Use this rotation:

1.  **Start with Google Antigravity or Project IDX** for your main development environment.
2.  **Use Bolt.new or Lovable** to scaffold your initial UI.
3.  **Hit a limit?** Export the code to **VS Code** with **Codeium** or **Cline** installed.
4.  **Need an API Key?** Use **Google AI Studio** to get a free Gemini API key and plug it into Cline/Roo Code.
5.  **Need a GPU?** Switch to **Colab** or **Kaggle** for heavy lifting.
6.  **Need a second opinion?** Paste the error into **Phind** or **Perplexity**.

By rotating between these tools, you leverage the "loss leader" strategies of multiple big tech companies, ensuring you always have a premium AI assistant ready to help, for zero dollars.
