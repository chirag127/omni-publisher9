# HOW TO GAIN SECRETS - GENERAL GUIDE
# ==============================================================================
# This section provides general guidance on finding API credentials for any platform.
#
# 1. LOOK FOR "DEVELOPER" OR "API" LINKS:
#    - Usually found in the footer of the website.
#    - Keywords: "Developers", "API", "Integrations", "Apps".
#
# 2. CREATE AN APPLICATION:
#    - Most APIs require you to register an "App".
#    - This identifies your script to the platform.
#    - You'll typically get a "Client ID" (Key) and "Client Secret".
#
# 3. AUTHENTICATION TYPES:
#    - API Key: Simple string, often passed in header (e.g., "Authorization: Api-Key ...").
#    - OAuth 2.0: Complex flow (Authorize -> Code -> Token). Use tools like Postman to get the initial token.
#    - Personal Access Token (PAT): Generated in user settings, easiest for scripts.
#    - Basic Auth: Username + Password (or App Password).
#
# 4. OAUTH CALLBACK URLS:
#    - If asked for a "Redirect URI" or "Callback URL", use "http://localhost" or "http://localhost:3000" if running locally.
#    - For scripts, you often copy the code/token manually from the browser URL after authorization.
#
# 5. SCOPES:
#    - APIs ask for "Scopes" (permissions).
#    - Always request minimum required: "read", "write", "post", "publish".
#    - For blogging, look for "content:write", "posts:write", "wall", "status".
#
# 6. RATE LIMITS:
#    - Free tiers have limits (e.g., 100 requests/hour).
#    - Check headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining) if your script fails.
#
# 7. SECURITY:
#    - NEVER commit this .env file to GitHub!
#    - Keep your Client Secrets and Access Tokens private.
#    - Regenerate them if you suspect a leak.
